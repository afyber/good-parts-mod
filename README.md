# The Good Parts Mod

This mod exists because I was feeling nostalgic.

The Good Parts Mod ~~allows you~~ (will allow you) to remove or customize almost any feature, mob, or structure added to Minecraft
 since the glory days of 1.7.10, all through the configuration file. However, it is currently a work-in-progress.

## Features

Currently:
* You can toggle Husks, Strays, and Drowned mobs on and off
* You can set Phantoms to only spawn one at a time
* Re-adds the recipe for the Notch Apple (No, you can't toggle this one, data files are evil to work with in code)

There's not very many right now

## Planned Features

* Ability to toggle every mob added since 1.7.10
* Ability to toggle certain items (Copper, Conduits, etc.)
* Ability to toggle events like raids
* Even bringing back zombie pigmen to replace piglins!

I would really like to do stuff related to recipes and world generation but that's difficult to do in such a way that it's configurable, so we'll see.
